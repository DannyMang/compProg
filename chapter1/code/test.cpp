//2. Given a list of integers L of size up to 1M items, determine whether a value v exists in L by
//not using more than 20 comparisons? (More details in Section 2.2.1).
///3. Given a date, determine what is the day (Monday, Tuesday, . . . , Sunday) of that date?
//(e.g. 9 August 2010 – the launch date of the first edition of this book – is Monday).
//4. Given a string, replace all ‘special words’ of length 3 with 3 stars “***”. The ‘special word’
//starts with a lowercase alphabet character and followed by two consecutive digits, e.g.
//S = “line: a70 and z72 will be replaced, but aa24 and a872 will not”
//will be transformed to
//S = “line: *** and *** will be replaced, but aa24 and a872 will not”.
//5. Write the shortest possible Java code to read in a double
//(e.g. 1.4732, 15.324547327, etc)
//and print it again, but now with minimum field width 7 and 3 digits after decimal point
//(e.g. ss1.473 (where ‘s’ denotes a space), s15.325, etc)
//6. Generate all possible permutations of {0, 1, 2, . . . , N-1}, for N = 10.
//7. Generate all possible subsets of {0, 1, 2, . . . , N-1}, for N = 20
